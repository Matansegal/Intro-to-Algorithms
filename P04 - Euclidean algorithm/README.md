# Algorithms-P04
The area of algorithm I chose is number theoretic algorithm. The problem I chose in the area is finding the greatest common divider (GCD) of two integers. The GCD is useful for reducing fractions to be the lowest terms. Also, it is useful to find the least common multiple of two integers which helpful in solving Diophantine equations

You can find the code of the project in a Jupyter notebook file, a .py file and as an HTML file above.
